# JSF 02 (Svelte Challenge) 

## Introduction

Welcome to the JSF 02 Svelte Challenge! This project assisted me in learning and practicing the building of a web application using Svelte, a lightweight and powerful JavaScript framework. In this challenge, I had the opportunity to build a real-world E-commerce application from scratch, using Svelte's unique features and best practices.

Throughout this project, I learnt how to create reusable components, manage state and props, handle events, and more. By the end of this challenge, I had a fully functional web application that showcases my skills and understanding of Svelte.
